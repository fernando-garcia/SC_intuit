**** Scoring a DNA sequence against a TFBS motif ****

Returns the scoring as defined in Garcia et al (2009)

Call: python intuit.py -fMotif <FileMotif> -fSeq <FileSeq>

<FileMotif>: text file describing the position count matrices (PSSM) and the binding sequences of the motif we want to score. See data/motif.txt as an example.

<FileSeq>: text file with the DNA sequence to be scored. See data/seq.txt as an example


Output:

The SC_intuit result

Example:

python intuit.py -fMotif data/motif.txt -fSeq data/seq.txt
