MATRIX

Contents

The MATRIX table contains nucleotide distribution matrices of aligned
binding sequences. These sequences may have been obtained by in vitro
selection studies or may be compiled sites of genes. The source is
appropriately indicated. The matrix entries have an identifier that
indicates one of six groups of biological species (V$, vertebrates; I$,
insects; P$, plants; F$, fungi; N$ nematodes; B$, bacteria), followed by
an acronym for the factor the matrix refers to, and a consecutive number
discriminating between different matrices for the same factor. Thus,
V$OCT1_02 indicates the second matrix for vertebral Oct-1 factor. Instead
of a consecutive number, the identifier of those matrices which have been
generated from TRANSFAC(r) SITE entries, end up with an abbreviation of
the least quality of the sites used to construct the matrix. For example,
V$CREB_Q2 is a matrix constructed of CREB binding sites of quality 2 or
better. This Q-value should not be mixed up with the high/low quality
criterion of the matrix, which is given in Match(TM)/Match(TM)Profiler.
Finally, a matrix with an identifier like V$AP1_C has been derived from a
"consensus description" constructed with the aid of ConsIndex (Frech et
al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21:1655-1664, 1993).
The matrix area gives the nucleotide frequencies observed in aligned
binding sites of the corresponding transcription factor (or, more general,
in aligned sites of the described function); an additional column depicts
the IUPAC string consensus derived from the matrix according to the
following rules (adapted from Cavener, Nucleic Acids Res. 15:1353-1361,
1987):
Rule 1: A single nucleotide (A,C,G,T) is shown if its frequency is at
        least 50% and at least twice as high as the second most frequent
        nucleotide.
Rule 2: A double-degenerate code indicates that the corresponding two
        nucleotides occur in more than 75% of the underlying sequences and 
        rule 1 does not apply: (W = A or T), (S = C or G), (R = A or G),
        (Y = C or T), (K = G or T), (M = A or C).
Rule 3: Usage of triple-degenerate codes is restricted to those positions
        where one of the nucleotides did not show up at all in the
        sequence set and none of the afore mentioned rules applies:(B = C, 
        G or T), (D = A, G or T), (H = A, C or T), (V = A, C or G).
Rule 4: All other frequency distributions are represented by the letter
        "N" (= A, C, G or T).

Alignment description

BS  Sequence segment (including gaps); Site link; Start; Length; Gaps; Orientation.

Examples:
BS  TGTTTGTCAAT; R08890; 9; 11;; p.             derived from TRANSFAC site    R08890
BS  TATTTACTTTC; C00278,  s00475; 2; 11;; n.    derived from TRANSCompel site s00475
                                                         in composite element C00278

The positions given refer to the sequence as shown in the site table.

For re-construction of alignment from site sequence
1. introduce gaps at the indicated positions
2. determine matrix start
3. determine matrix length
4. orientation: p (positive), i.e. as in site entry / n (negative) = reverse complement
